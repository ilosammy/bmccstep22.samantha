During the day I worked on 2 topics within the Python 2 course. The 2 topics were "Python Syntax" and "Strings and counsole input".
Both topics were extremely informative and helped me learn the beginning basics of Python.
It taught us mainly about strings and variable and even taught us how we can use those skills to find information that is important.
For example the time and date. I learn to simply find out the time and date through code by using datetime and telling the computer
to tell me this information with the use of "print "%02d/%02d/%04d %02d:%02d:%02d" % (now.month, now.day, now.year, now.hour, now.minute, now.second)".
Now usually before this class I would have no clue on what that meant but after todaY I'm able to understand that and so much more
I felt strong in picking up the new coding techniques found in each lesson
I felt weak in being able to througly check my code after finding out there was a typo
I can adress this in the future by making sure I type the code out correctly as I go
