Today I worked on pig latin, we used code to transform a word of our choice into pig latin which means to take the first letter of the world (referred to number 0 in code) and it brings it to the back of the word in which u add on a ay. We created a command that could do it for us allowing us to work with various techniques learnt from previous lessons like variables, strings, .lower() and more.
